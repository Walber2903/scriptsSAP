###The Project
I built this project during the MASTERMR python course. In this course we build modules to be able to use in our day to day, making scripts for the ERP - SAP, analyzing data, using e-mail service, extracting information from the WEB as well as other challenges.

Today I started to use it in my day to day, mainly in the automated removal of SAP reports.
